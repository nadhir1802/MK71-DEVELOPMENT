        <h1>Our Development Process</h1>
  
        <p><strong>1. Identify the Problem or Purpose:</strong><br>
        Every successful project begins with a goal. Whether it's a business need, a personal passion, or an online service, we take time to understand exactly what your website should achieve.</p>
  
        <p><strong>2. Conduct In-Depth Research:</strong><br>
        We research your audience and competitors to find out what works and what doesn’t. This helps us create a site that’s both effective and unique.</p>
  
        <p><strong>3. Define Features and Functionality:</strong><br>
        Before designing anything, we list the features your site will need—like a navigation menu, image gallery, forms, or blog section.</p>
  
        <p><strong>4. Sketch the Design and Map the User Journey:</strong><br>
        Using rough sketches or digital wireframes, we plan the layout of each page to ensure easy navigation and a great experience.</p>
  
        <p><strong>5. Create a Prototype:</strong><br>
        A working model of your site helps us fine-tune the layout and features before final development.</p>
  
        <p><strong>6. Start Building the Application:</strong><br>
        We use modern tools and code to bring your vision to life, keeping you updated every step of the way.</p>
  
        <p><strong>7. Test and Validate Thoroughly:</strong><br>
        We test everything to ensure it works perfectly across devices, browsers, and screen sizes.</p>
  
        <p><strong>8. Deploy the App to a Live Environment:</strong><br>
        After testing, your site goes live! We also offer long-term support and updates.</p>
